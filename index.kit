                        "Thank you to the office of Dr. James Roy!

                        We can't say enough wonderful things about your office.
                        Every visit is so much fun! Many people will read this
                        and question the word "fun", but until you become a
                        patient or parent of a patient, you will not understand.

                        The office has a dynamic chemistry of people who welcome
                        you from your first visit until the last visit. I have
                        two children so I continue to enjoy my new "friends" at
                        Dr. Roy's office.

                        Thank you for all the great orthodontic care and making
                        my children feel welcome and special! I continue to tell
                        all of my friends about this great office."

                        "We have been patients of Dr. Roy for two and a half
                        years. My two sons and husband have always received
                        excellent care.

                        Dr. Roy and his staff are very professional while still
                        being personal. They understand the different needs of
                        each patient and their families. Each and every step of
                        treatment over the past years have been explained in a
                        clear yet friendly manner.

                        I always recommend Dr. Roy whenever I am asked where we
                        go for orthodontics. We are having three positive
                        experiences!"

                        will all probably need to have orthodontic work done, we
                        asked many friends in the community for their advice on
                        choosing an orthodontist. Dr. Roy was clearly the best
                        choice for our family. Three of our children have
                        already been patients for quite some time and we have
                        another child scheduled to get her braces next week. Dr.
                        Roy and his staff have always made our family feel
                        comfortable and we are always greeted with a smile. I
                        strongly recommend Dr. Roy for your orthodontic needs!"
