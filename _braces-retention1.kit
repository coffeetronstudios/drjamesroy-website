<p>
    Traditional braces and most appliances including Clear Correct (Invisalign),
    require follow-up visits every 3-6 weeks depending upon your specific
    treatment plan. Each visit lasts approximately 20 to 30 minutes.
    Occasionally a longer appointment may be necessary. We will provide
    adequate notice so that you are able to plan accordingly. Following removal
    of your braces, we will begin the retention phase of your treatment.
